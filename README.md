# Eyvaz Bayramov

Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Eyvaz Bayramov and I am interested in DevOps, Linux and software development. I'm still learning, but I love learning new technologies, building cool stuff, and getting things going smoothly.

## Skills and Interests

- **DevOps:** I'm getting into DevOps and learning about continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), infrastructure as code (IaC), and containers. It's amazing how these techniques help automate processes and make software development more efficient.

- **Linux:** I enjoy working with Linux and using powerful command line tools (like build systems, CLI editors like VIM, NEOVIM, shell scripting) to get things done. There is so much to learn about the Linux ecosystem and I can't wait to dive deeper. 
- Linux is my main operating system and I set up all my projects on Linux. I currently use Arch Linux and am constantly learning and expanding my knowledge to become more proficient. My goal is to have a deep understanding of Linux and be a competent resource in the Linux community.

- **Software Development:** I have some experience in software development. I've dabbled in Python, C++/C and Rust and can't wait to learn more.

## projects

I have worked on several projects and here are some highlights:

1. **Automated Deployment Pipeline**. I recently created a pipeline using Jenkins and Docker. It helps automate the process of building, testing, and deploying web applications. It was a great learning experience!

2. **Infrastructure as code**. I have been looking into tools like Terraform and Ansible to automate the provisioning and management of cloud resources on AWS. It's amazing to see how we can build and manage infrastructure with code.

## Contributions

I believe in the power of open source and collaboration. Although I'm still relatively new, I've started contributing to projects on GitHub. Sometimes it's fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving the documentation. I love being part of the community and helping out when I can.

## Contact

If you would like to contact me, email me at [my email](mailto:eyvaz.bayramov2018@gmail.com) or contact me on LinkedIn [here](). I'm always open to discussing new opportunities, collaborating on projects, or even just having a friendly conversation about technology.
